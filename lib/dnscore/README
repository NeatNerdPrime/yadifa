    YADIFA 2.4.1-public

    Fixes an issue in dnscore where a DNS TCP query would not return the real DNS error code.
    Fixes an issue that could happen when a network model isn't supported.
    Fixes the propagation of sendmmsg/recvmmsg function availability detection.
    Fixes an issue where yadifad would issue a warning when a key with algorithm > 7 is used with an NSEC zone.
    Fixes an issue that will occur on a chrooted environment where a managed-path would be used incorrectly.
    Fixes CNAME answers not following the aliases chain.
    Fixes CNAME recursion not returning the same answer as named in NXDOMAIN cases (reported by https://github.com/SivaKesava1, see https://github.com/yadifa/yadifa/issues/11)

    Adds patch for musl support (from https://github.com/kolbma, see https://github.com/yadifa/yadifa/issues/9#issuecomment-723047226)
    Adds stack size fix for musl support (the default size is way too small)

    Now imports a custom version of stdatomic.h for systems where it is missing, located in dnscore/thirdpary/stdatomic.h
	Made for CentOS 7 and any other release where that file is missing.
        The import is only active if strictly needed and will only be visible during the build.
	At the moment, it is not being installed with the other headers.
	The original source of the file was taken from https://gist.github.com/nhatminhle/5181506

    YAKEYROLLD 2.4.1

    Fixes the handling of incomplete TCP queries.
    Fixes a possible race-condition when initialising the keyroll context error codes.

    The keyroll now has another automatic recovery layer where it completely restarts the handling of a domain, generating a one-step update to put the zone in the expected state.
