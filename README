YADIFA is a lightweight authoritative Name Server with DNSSEC capabilities. Developed by the passionate people behind
the .eu top-level domain, YADIFA has been built from scratch to face todayâ€™s DNS challenges, with no compromise on
security, speed and stability, to offer a better and safer Internet experience.

YADIFA has a simple configuration syntax and can handle more queries per second while maintaining one of the lowest
memory footprints in the industry. YADIFA also has one of the fastest zone file load times ever recorded on a name
server.

YADIFA is developed on GNU/Linux. It works on FreeBSD and will be soon ported to other Unix flavors like
Mac OS. A Microsoft Windows version is also on the cards.
